# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The following features are added to the Snake Game as a part of this project
 1. Implemented obstacles in the game. If snake hits an obstacle, it will die.
 2. Draw border for the playground. If snake hit the border, it will die.
 3. Implemented a startup screen that will display the game rules. Hit any key to continue.
 4. Rendered snake, obstacle and food with images.
 5. Displayed an end message that helps the player to get final score information.
